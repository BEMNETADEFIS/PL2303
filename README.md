PL2303
======

This is an Open Source PL2303 driver for recent versions of Mac OS X since 10.8.

This is a derivative work of BJA Electronics, Jeroen Arnoldus (opensource@bja-electronics.nl) nl.bjaelectronics.driver.PL2303 project.  

I have added the needed elements for power management on newer versions of Mac OS X and added a signed version you can download if you so desire.  

  Enjoy :-).  It was spawned of neccessity, and I figured others could use it too.
